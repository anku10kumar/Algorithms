Short Answer

1 .What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Answer: searching your car in the parking lot by searching all the cars one by one

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Answer: When you search for words in a dictionary, you don't review all the words; you just check one word in the middle and thus narrow down the set of remaining words to check.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

Answer: 7 

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

Answer: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: Linear search, because binary search doesnâ€™t work with unsorted collections 

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: Binary search because it is more efficient. 


Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

Answer: 


var names = ["Albatross", "Ted", "Dave", "Dog", "Tree", "Chair"];

function WordSearch(arr, val){ 
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);
    
    if(arr[mid] > val) { 
      high = arr[mid -1];
    } 
    else if (arr[mid] < val) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    }
    else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "Name not found";
}

console.log(WordSearch(names, "Albatross"));

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

Answer: 

var goldfish = ['spotted' , "white" , "red" , "black"] 
function findGoldfish(collection, target){

  var res = null, value;

  for (var i =0; i<collection.length; i++){
    value = collection[i]; 
    if (value ===target){
      res =i; 
    }
  }
  return res; 
}

console.log(findGoldfish(goldfish,"white"));
