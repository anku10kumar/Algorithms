Short Answer

Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. 


If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A:  Pseudocode has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus canâ€™t be compiled or interpreted by the computer.


Programming Assignment


Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

* Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

PROGRAM PrintBiggerOfTwo: 

Read A;
Read B; 
IF (A>B) 

    THEN Print A;
    ELSE Print B; 

   ENDIF; 


* Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

PROGRAM Print1to100:

  A = 1; 

  WHILE (A<101)

  DO Print A; 

      A = A+1; 

 ENDWHILE; 

* Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Get first entry; 
Call this entry N; 
WHILE N is NOT the required entry 
DO Get next entry;
   Call this entry N;
ENDWHILE; 

* Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

1. function great(a,b){

if (a>b) {
 return a;  
} else { 

return b; 
} 
}

2. function print1to100 (){ 

var a = 1; 
while (a < 101) {
  console.log(a);
  a++;
}
}
print1to100()

3. function entry(arr, N){

for (var i= 0; i<arr.length; i++){

while (arr[i] === N) { 

return i}
